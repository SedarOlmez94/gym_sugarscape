                amount of reward achieved by the previous action. The scale
                varies between environments, but the goal is always to increase
                your total reward.

                whether it's time to reset the environment again. Most (but not
                all) tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and done
                being True indicates the episode has terminated. (For example,

                 diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes
